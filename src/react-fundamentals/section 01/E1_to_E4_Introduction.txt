[01] Introduction

What is react ?
	• React is an open source library for building user interfaces.
	• It is not a framework. Its main focus is to develop UI.
	• It has a rich ecosystem.

Advantages of react
	• React has a component based architecture.
	• Reusable code.
	• React is declarative -
		○ Tell React what you want and React will build the actual UI.
		○ React will handle efficiently updating and rendering of the components.
		○ DOM updates are handled gracefully in React.
	• React can be integrated into any application.
		(portion of a page or a complete page or an entire application)
	• React native for mobile applications.

[02] Creating a new React app

    Method 1 : Using npx - npx create-react-app project_name
			(npx helps us to create-react-app without having to install it)
    Method 2 : Using npm - 
		npm install create-react-app -g (installs the create-react-app package globally) create-react-app project_name (creates the react project)

[03] React folder structure

	• package.json : contains scripts and dependencies required for the project.
	• package-lock.json, .git-ignore  & README.md file.
	• node_modules : folder where all dependencies are installed.
	• public folder : 
		manifest.json (for progressive web apps),
		favicon.ico,
		index.html
	• src folder : index.js (starting point for our application),
		App.js (responsible for HTML displayed in the browser),
		App.css (for styling),
		App.test.js (for unit testing),
		index.css (styles for body tag)

[04] components

	• A component represents a part of the UI.
		e.g. App/Root component (contains other components like header, sidenav, main, footer).
	• All components together make up the entire application.
	• Components are re-usable. (i.e. we can pass different property to component to display different information)
	• Components can contain other components (nesting of components).

	Component types -
		• Functional component - are JS functions which returns HTML (JSX) that describes the UI.
		• Class component - are regular ES6 classes that extend the Component class from react library. They must contain a render method that returns the HTML (JSX).
